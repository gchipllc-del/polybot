"""
Curated RSS/Atom feed list for prediction-market-moving news ingestion.

Feed list adapted from koala73/worldmonitor
(https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor), (c) 2024-2026 Elie Habib,
licensed under GNU AGPL-3.0.

Feed URLs are factual data (not copyrightable), but attribution retained
for provenance. See /NOTICE at repo root for full license text reference.

AGPL NOTE: polybot runs on paper/play bankroll by default. Before any
    commercial / hosted deployment, either (a) replace this feed list
    with independently curated sources, or (b) license worldmonitor
    commercially. Importing the worldmonitor code itself would trigger
    AGPL SS13 (network copyleft) on the Flask dashboard -- we only port
    the URL list, not any parsing code.

Why this matters for polybot specifically: prediction markets on Kalshi/
Polymarket/Manifold resolve on real-world events. A broad, deep feed of
macro/geopolitics/central-bank/tech news materially improves the
NewsFeed sentiment pipeline's coverage vs. the legacy 11 hardcoded BBC/
NYT/Cointelegraph sources.

Categories:
  - markets:     Equities, bonds, commodities, crypto, forex-specific
  - macro:       Central banks, rate decisions, CPI/GDP/PMI, Treasury
  - geopolitics: Foreign policy, defense, sanctions, trade wars
  - tech:        Market-moving tech + AI research
  - general:     Broad news that occasionally moves markets
